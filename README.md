- 👋 Hi, I’m @Maxwell-Clark
- 👀 I’m a Software Engineer based out of Little Rock, Arkansas. I love to learn, and I am doing so constantly! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to master computer science. I know its a lofty goal but I will become the greatest software engineer in the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help others while helping me improve myself. I am very interested in working for non-profits and helping others with software!
